# ReservationSys
A Hotel Reservation System written in Java during our 2nd year CompSci.
Our very first semester-long project written with Object Oriented Programming and best practices.
Also our first time using Git for team project collaboration, it was a learning process (so commit messages were not very good).

## About the Application
* User can reserve hotel room(s) for an amount of people
* User selects a check-in date and a check-out date
* User gets to choose the type of room (regular, penthouse, etc) in a particular floor.
* User is notified if a floor is full or a type of room is not available in a floor
